# `src/locator_repair.py`

## High-Level Purpose

Surgical replacement of a broken locator in a generated test file. Replaces only the locator string while preserving the surrounding action (`.click()`, `.fill()`, etc.). Design-time only — not used at test runtime.

## Module Metadata

- **Lines:** 151
- **Imports:** `re`, `dataclasses`, `pathlib.Path`

## Data Classes

### `LocatorPatch`

Describes a single locator replacement.
- `original_locator: str` — The broken locator string from the error
- `repaired_locator: str` — The corrected locator (e.g., from codegen)
- `line_number: int` — 1-based line in the generated test to patch
- `test_file: str | Path` — Path to the generated test file

### `LocatorRepairError(Exception)`

Raised when the target locator could not be found on the expected line.

## Functions

### `apply_patch(patch: LocatorPatch) -> str`

Apply a locator patch to the test source and return the patched source. Finds the line containing `original_locator`, replaces only the locator string inside `.locator("...")`, preserves the action. Searches +/- 10 lines around reported line number since Playwright error lines don't always match the locator call line.

### `apply_patch_to_file(patch: LocatorPatch) -> None`

Apply a locator patch and write the result back to disk.

### `extract_locator_from_line(line: str) -> str | None`

Extract the locator string from a single line of test code. Looks for `.locator("...")` pattern.
